# ***Modify Image Alpha***

### This is a Blender Add-on that modifies the alpha data of a *Source Image* based on the data from an image mask.

Both images **MUST** be PNG files of the same size. <br>
The *Alpha Image* must be either a greyscale image or an image with alpha data to transfer to the *Source Image*.<br>
There is a *checkbox* to indicate where to take the alpha data from.<br>
*Check* the box to trnasfer the *alpha* data to the *Source Image*.<br>
*Uncheck* the box to use a *greyscale* mask as the alpha data to transfer to the *Source Image*.
By default it is left *unchecked*.
